# CoCoLoCa
** MC6847T1 VDG Conversion for CoCo 1 and 2 **
 
The **CoCoLoCa** allows installation of an MC6847T1/XC80652P in a Radio Shack Colour Computer 1 or 2

This is based on the work of Tony DiStefano as published in the October through December 1986 issues of Rainbow magazine.
This design has not been tested, so assuming you can find one of these rare chips, use at your own risk.

Over the course of two or three articles, Tony explains how to install the new VDG in the Colour Computer, and how to use switches to configure text mode.
This design attempts to cover both the installation and provide jumpers for the text mode settings.

The main PCB lets you plug the new VDG in.

This PCB has two fly out lines that have to go to the SAM chip, which I plan to make another PCB to avoid soldering to the chip directly or using clip on leads that tend to fall off.

The config plug PCB configures your Coco for the new VDG.

Tony suggests that this might not be universal, and may require a different configuration for Coco2 models, so expect to see more plugable boards if that turns out to be the case.

Happy SepTandy 2022!
